        <b><p>Rabbit Origami</p></b>
        <p>A baby rabbit is called a kit, a female is called a doe and a male is called a buck.
            Rabbits are very social creatures that live in groups.
            A rabbit's teeth never stop growing!
            Rabbits perform an athletic leap, known as a 'binky', when they're happy — performing twists and kicks in mid air!</p>

        <b>Turtle Origami</b>
        <p>Turtles are some of the oldest animals around.
            The largest turtles weigh more than a thousand pounds.
            A turtle's shell is not an exoskeleton.
            Turtles have a second shell.
            Turtles aren't silent.</p>

        <b><p>Penguin Origami</p></b>
        <p> group of penguins in the water is called a raft but on land they're called a waddle!
            The black and white “tuxedo” look donned by most penguin species is a clever camouflage called countershading.
            Penguins may huddle together for several reasons. 
            Penguins evolved to fly underwater.</p>
